# Core version
# ------------
# Each makefile should begin by declaring the core version of Drupal that all
# projects should be compatible with.

core: '7.x'


# API version
# ------------
# Every makefile needs to declare it's Drush Make API version. This version of
# drush make uses API version `2`.

api: 2

# Core project
# ------------
# In order for your makefile to generate a full Drupal site, you must include
# a core project. This is usually Drupal core, but you can also specify
# alternative core projects like Pressflow. Note that makefiles included with
# install profiles *should not* include a core project.

# Use Pressflow instead of Drupal core:
# projects:
#   pressflow:
#     type: "core"
#     download:
#       type: "file"
#       url: "http://launchpad.net/pressflow/6.x/6.15.73/+download/pressflow-6.15.73.tar.gz"
#
# Git clone of Drupal 7.x. Requires the `core` property to be set to 7.x.
# projects
#   drupal:
#     type: "core"
#     download:
#       url: "http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git"
